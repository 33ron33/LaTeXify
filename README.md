# LaTeXify

This Repository will be used to create an **Application** (Mobile-first: iOS & Android) and later a **Website Backend** where we build a platform to:

> Instantly transform handwritten notes, textbook pages, Word documents, and PDFs into clean, editable LaTeX code, making scientific writing faster, easier, and accessible to students, researchers, and academics worldwide.

---

# Vision

**LaTeXify** aims to bridge the gap between analog thinking (handwritten notes, physical documents) and digital publication (LaTeX papers, theses, reports), empowering researchers to focus on ideas instead of formatting.

"**From Snap to Publish in Seconds.**"

# Roadmap

## 1. Environment Setup
- Install Flutter SDK and Dart.
- Install Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter & Dart plugins.
- Set up emulators and device testing.
- Initialize Git repository for version control.

## 2. Application Development Plan

### Phase 1: Mobile App (MVP for iOS & Android)
- App Initialization and Structure
- Home Screen:
  - Capture Image (Camera/Gallery)
  - Upload Word/PDF Documents
- Real-time OCR Processing:
  - Basic Tesseract/MLKit OCR integration
  - Mathpix API integration (for premium high-accuracy conversion)
- Display LaTeX Output:
  - Editable TextArea for corrections
  - Export Options:
    - Save as .tex file
    - Share via system share sheet
    - Copy to Clipboard
- Authentication:
  - Firebase Auth (email/password, Google Sign-in)
- Usage Tracking:
  - Free Tier Limits (5 conversions/day)
- In-app Purchases:
  - Monthly/Yearly Subscription for unlimited conversions
- Analytics and Crash Reporting:
  - Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics integration

### Phase 2: Backend Development
- Custom Python (FastAPI) backend:
  - Handle DOCX to LaTeX conversion (Pandoc)
  - Handle PDF to LaTeX conversion (PyMuPDF + OCR)
  - Secure API endpoints (Authentication tokens)
- Deploy backend using Cloud Run or AWS Lightsail
- (Later) Host Landing Page Website

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Post-MVP)
- Real-time LaTeX Preview (MathJax/Katex rendering)
- Collaborative Features (Share with peers)
- Project Management (Group images/docs into LaTeX Projects)
- Equation Editor Toolbar (Insert symbols easily)
- Direct Overleaf Integration (Stretch Goal)
- Offline OCR Mode (limited)
